# motivational-meme

Welcome to my "Motivational Meme" project! This HTML and CSS project is designed to create a motivational meme or poster that combines an inspiring quote with an eye-catching image. In this project, I've used various CSS properties, including fonts and the CSS box model, to construct the poster.

## Project Overview

- **Title**: Motivational Meme
- **Objective**: Create a motivational poster with an inspiring quote and image.

### HTML Structure

- **`<div>` Element with Class `poster`**: This container holds the image, title, and quote for the motivational meme.

  - **Image**: An image of Sisyphus is displayed with the alt text "Sisyphus image."
  
  - **`<h1>` Element with Class `text`**: This heading displays the title "Purpose."

  - **`<p>` Element with Class `text`**: A paragraph displays the inspiring quote: "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart."

### CSS Styling

- **External Stylesheet**: The project uses an external CSS stylesheet named "style.css" for styling.

- **Fonts**: CSS is applied to style the fonts for the title and the quote text.

- **Box Model**: The CSS box model properties are used to control spacing, padding, and margins to create an appealing layout.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the motivational meme by viewing the HTML file. The combination of the inspiring quote and the image creates a visually appealing and motivational message.

This project serves as an example of using HTML and CSS to construct motivational posters or memes with custom styling.

Enjoy the motivational message!
